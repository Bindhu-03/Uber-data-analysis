# Uber-data-analysis
Uber Data Analysis Project

# Overview

This project involves analyzing Uber data to extract meaningful insights. The analysis was conducted using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The primary objectives include understanding user patterns, identifying peak usage times, and exploring other key trends in the dataset.

# Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover trends

- Visualization of key insights

- Identification of peak hours and demand patterns

# Technologies Used

Python

Jupyter Notebook

--> Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation

--> Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

# File Structure

Uber_Data_Analysis_Project.ipynb: Contains the code and analysis for the project.

# Key Insights

Peak Usage Hours: Analysis reveals the busiest times for Uber rides.

Demand Patterns: Identified trends in demand across different days and times.

Data Visualization: Graphs and charts provide a clear understanding of user behavior.

# How to Use

Clone this repository.

Open the Uber_Data_Analysis_Project.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook.

Run the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.
